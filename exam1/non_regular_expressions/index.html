<p><strong>Problem 1: Is B regular? \(B = \{0^{n}1^{n} \mid n \geq 0\}\)</strong>
<br><br> <strong>Step 1: Understand </strong><span class="highlight" onclick="openModal('regular')">what constitutes a regular Language</span>
<br><br> <strong>Step 2: Evaulate the expression</strong>
<ul>
    <li onclick="toggleSublist(this)" style="cursor: pointer;">\(0^{n}1^{n}\mid n \geq 0\)</li>
    <ul class="sublist">
        <li>The expression means that for every \(n\), there are exactly \(n\) zeros followed by \(n\) ones.</li>
        <li>Because \(n\) can be arbitrarily large, a finite automaton would need an infinite number of states to remember how many zeros it has seen in order to match them with the same number of ones.</li>
        <li>Since DFAs and NFAs have a fixed, finite number of states, they cannot perform this <strong>unbounded counting.</strong></li>
        <li>Therefore, no DFA or NFA exists for this language, which means it is not a regular language.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2: What is the pigeonhole principle and how does it relate to DFAs?</strong>
<br><br><strong> Step 1: Explain the Pigeonhole Principle</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>In the simplest terms possible, if you have n cages and n-1 pigeons, there must be a cage that holds more than one pigeon.</li>
</ul>
<br><strong> Step 2: Explain how it relates to DFAs</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>A DFA has a limited (finite) number of states.</li>
    <li>When a DFA processes an input with more symbols than available states, it must revisit a state (by the pigeonhole principle).</li>
    <li>This means the DFA cycles, or loops, through some of its states.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This cycle can be repeated (or "pumped") any number of times, which is a key property of regular languages and leads us to the construct of <strong>pumping lemmas</strong></strong>.</li>
        <li>If a language requires a strict one-to-one matching (like \(0^n1^n\)), it cannot be captured by these cycles, so it is non-regular.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Problem 3: Explain The Proof: The Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages</strong>
<br><br><strong>Step 1: Understand What <span class="highlight" onclick="openModal('pump')">Pumping Lemma</span> Is</strong>
<br><br><strong>Step 2: Interpreting the Proof</strong>
<img src="proof.png" class="small-img" alt="Proof of Pumping Lemma">
<ul>
    <li>We start off with a DFA recognizing a language A and let the pumping length, p, be set to the number of states in our DFA.</li>
  
    <li>We consider a string s in the language A such that its length (n) is at least p.</li>
  
    <li>We need to show that s can be split into three parts (x, y, z) in a way that meets the pumping conditions.</li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>Understanding the Sequence of States:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>As the DFA reads s, it moves through a sequence of states while processing each character.</li>
        <li>Since the DFA has only p states but the string is at least p characters long, the pigeonhole principle tells us that at least one state must repeat.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>Identifying the Repeat:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We name the first occurrence of this repeated state as r<sub>j</sub> and the second as r<sub>k</sub>.</li>
        <li>This means that while processing s, the DFA enters the same state at two different points.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>Splitting the String:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>x:</strong> The part of s that takes the DFA from the start to the first occurrence of the repeated state.</li>
        <li><strong>y:</strong> The part of s that takes the DFA from the first to the second occurrence of the repeated state (this is the "repeatable" part).</li>
        <li><strong>z:</strong> The remaining part of s.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>Why This Works:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the DFA ends up in the same state after reading x and then xy, it means that we can repeat y any number of times and still stay within the language.</li>
        <li>Since j ≠ k, we know that y is not empty (|y| > 0).</li>
        <li>Since the repeated state happens within the first p steps, we know that |xy| ≤ p.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>Thus, we have proven that all three conditions of the pumping lemma hold, meaning any sufficiently long string in a regular language can be "pumped."</li>
  
    <li>This proof helps us show that some languages are <strong>not</strong> regular—because if we find a language where this pumping property doesn't hold, then the language must be more complex than what a DFA can handle.</li>
  </ul>

        <!-- Brief Explanation of what constitutes a regular language -->
        <h2>Understanding What Makes a Language Regular</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Whenever a DFA exists for a language, it means an NFA exists for that language as well, which by definition makes that language regular.</li>
            <li>DFAs (or NFAs) can only recognize languages that don't require more memory than what a finite number of states can hold.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a language has properties that require unbounded counting, nested/recursive structures, or matching, then that language is no longer regular </li>

        <!-- Brief Explanation of what constitutes a regular language -->
        <h2>Pumping Lemmas</h2>
        <h3>What:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>The Pumping Lemma is a way to prove that some languages are not regular (cannot be recognized by simple machines like finite state automatas)</li>
            <li>It states the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a language is regular, long enough words in it must have a repeatable (pumpable) part</li>
                <li>If you can find a word where no part can be pumped (repeated) without breaking the rules of the language, then the language is not regular</li>
            </ul>
            <li>It's called a lemma (step to proving larger theorem) because we use it to show that some languages are not regular.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it's implied that pumping lemmas are mainly used for proofs by contradiction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Formal Definition (The Three Rules)</h3>
        Formal Definition: The Pumping Lemma for regular languages states that if a language is regular, then any sufficiently long string in teh language can be split into three parts \(x,y,z\) such that the following rules hold:
        <ul>
            <li>Rule 1: The string can be split as 
                \[
                    s = xyz
                \]  
                where \(x,y,z\) are substrings
            </li>
            <li>Rule 2: The middle part (\(y\)) must be repeatable (pumped): 
                \[
                xy^iz \in L \text{ for all } i \geq 0
                \]
                This means you can remove \(y \, (i=0)\) or repeat it multiple times (i = 2, 3, ...) and the resulting
                string should still be valid in the language.
                <br>\(y^i\) is just y concatenated with itself \(i\) times.
            </li>
            <li>Rule 3: The pumped part \(y\) must not be empty and must be within a limited length:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>\(|y| > 0\): The repeatable part can't be empty</li>
                <li>\(|xy| \leq p\): The first two parts together must be within the "pumping length" \(p\), which depends on the language.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
